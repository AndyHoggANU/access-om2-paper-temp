@article{Hallberg2013a,
	Abstract = {Abstract Mesoscale eddies play a substantial role in the dynamics of the ocean, but the dominant length-scale of these eddies varies greatly with latitude, stratification and ocean depth. Global numerical ocean models with spatial resolutions ranging from 1$\,^{\circ}$ down to just a few kilometers include both regions where the dominant eddy scales are well resolved and regions where the model's resolution is too coarse for the eddies to form, and hence eddy effects need to be parameterized. However, common parameterizations of eddy effects via a Laplacian diffusion of the height of isopycnal surfaces (a Gent--McWilliams diffusivity) are much more effective at suppressing resolved eddies than in replicating their effects. A variant of the Phillips model of baroclinic instability illustrates how eddy effects might be represented in ocean models. The ratio of the first baroclinic deformation radius to the horizontal grid spacing indicates where an ocean model could explicitly simulate eddy effects; a function of this ratio can be used to specify where eddy effects are parameterized and where they are explicitly modeled. One viable approach is to abruptly disable all the eddy parameterizations once the deformation radius is adequately resolved; at the discontinuity where the parameterization is disabled, isopycnal heights are locally flattened on the one side while eddies grow rapidly off of the enhanced slopes on the other side, such that the total parameterized and eddy fluxes vary continuously at the discontinuity in the diffusivity. This approach should work well with various specifications for the magnitude of the eddy diffusivities. },

	Abstract = {<p>The overturning pathways for the surface-ventilated North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) and Antarctic Bottom Water (AABW) and the diffusively formed Indian Deep Water (IDW) and Pacific Deep Water (PDW) are intertwined. The global overturning circulation (GOC) includes both large wind-driven upwelling in the Southern Ocean and important internal diapycnal transformation in the deep Indian and Pacific Oceans. All three northern-source Deep Waters (NADW, IDW, PDW) move southward and upwell in the Southern Ocean. AABW is produced from the denser, salty NADW and a portion of the lighter, low oxygen IDW/PDW that upwells above and north of NADW. The remaining upwelled IDW/PDW stays near the surface, moving into the subtropical thermoclines, and ultimately sources about one-third of the NADW. Another third of the NADW comes from AABW upwelling in the Atlantic. The remaining third comes from AABW upwelling to the thermocline in the Indian-Pacific. Atlantic cooling associated with NADW formation (0.3 PW north of 32 degrees S; 1 PW = 1015 W) and Southern Ocean cooling associated with AABW formation (0.4 PW south of 32 degrees S) are balanced mostly by 0.6 PW of deep diffusive heating in the Indian and Pacific Oceans; only 0.1 PW is gained at the surface in the Southern Ocean. Thus, while an adiabatic model of NADW global overturning driven by winds in the Southern Ocean, with buoyancy added only at the surface in the Southern Ocean, is a useful dynamical idealization, the associated heat changes require full participation of the diffusive Indian and Pacific Oceans, with a basin-averaged diffusivity on the order of the Munk value of 10(-4) m(2) s(-1).</p>

@article{Barnier2006,
	Abstract = {Series of sensitivity tests were performed with az-coordinate, global eddy-permitting (1/4?) ocean/sea-ice model (the ORCA-R025 model configuration developed for the DRAKKAR project) to carefully evaluate the impact of recent state-of-the-art numerical schemes on model solutions. The combination of an energy?enstrophy conserving (EEN) scheme for momentum advection with a partial step (PS) representation of the bottom topography yields significant improvements in the mean circulation. Well known biases in the representation of western boundary currents, such as in the Atlantic the detachment of the Gulf Stream, the path of the North Atlantic Current, the location of the Confluence, and the strength of the Zapiola Eddy in the south Atlantic, are partly corrected. Similar improvements are found in the Pacific, Indian, and Southern Oceans, and characteristics of the mean flow are generally much closer to observations. Comparisons with other state-of-the-art models show that the ORCA-R025 configuration generally performs better at similar resolution. In addition, the model solution is often comparable to solutions obtained at 1/6 or 1/10? resolution in some aspects concerning mean flow patterns and distribution of eddy kinetic energy. Although the reasons for these improvements are not analyzed in detail in this paper, evidence is shown that the combination of EEN with PS reduces numerical noise near the bottom, which is likely to affect current?topography interactions in a systematic way. We conclude that significant corrections of the mean biases presently seen in general circulation model solutions at eddy-permitting resolution can still be expected from the development of numerical methods, which represent an alternative to increasing resolution.},

@article{Farneti2015,
	Abstract = {In the framework of the second phase of the Coordinated Ocean-ice Reference Experiments (CORE-II), we present an analysis of the representation of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and Southern Ocean meridional overturning circulation (MOC) in a suite of seventeen global ocean-sea ice models. We focus on the mean, variability and trends of both the ACC and MOC over the 1958-2007 period, and discuss their relationship with the surface forcing. We aim to quantify the degree of eddy saturation and eddy compensation in the models participating in CORE-II, and compare our results with available observations, previous fine-resolution numerical studies and theoretical constraints. Most models show weak ACC transport sensitivity to changes in forcing during the past five decades, and they can be considered to be in an eddy saturated regime. Larger contrasts arise when considering MOC trends, with a majority of models exhibiting significant strengthening of the MOC during the late 20th and early 21st century. Only a few models show a relatively small sensitivity to forcing changes, responding with an intensified eddy-induced circulation that provides some degree of eddy compensation, while still showing considerable decadal trends. Both ACC and MOC interannual variabilities are largely controlled by the Southern Annular Mode (SAM). Based on these results, models are clustered into two groups. Models with constant or two-dimensional (horizontal) specification of the eddy-induced advection coefficient $\kappa$ show larger ocean interior decadal trends, larger ACC transport decadal trends and no eddy compensation in the MOC. Eddy-permitting models or models with a three-dimensional time varying $\kappa$ show smaller changes in isopycnal slopes and associated ACC trends, and partial eddy compensation. As previously argued, a constant in time or space $\kappa$ is responsible for a poor representation of mesoscale eddy effects and cannot properly simulate the sensitivity of the ACC and MOC to changing surface forcing. Evidence is given for a larger sensitivity of the MOC as compared to the ACC transport, even when approaching eddy saturation. Future process studies designed for disentangling the role of momentum and buoyancy forcing in driving the ACC and MOC are proposed.},

	Abstract = {Simulations characteristics from eighteen global ocean - seaice coupled models are presented with a focus on the mean Atlantic MOC and other related fields in the North Atlantic. These experiments use inter-annually varying atmospheric forcing data sets for the 60-year period from 1948 to 2007 and are performed as contributions to the second phase of the CORE-II. The protocol for conducting such CORE-II experiments is summarized. Despite using the same atmospheric forcing data sets, the solutions show significant inter-model differences. As most models also differ from available observations, biases in sea-ice cover, upper-ocean potential temperature and salinity distributions, and mixed layer depths in the labrador Sea region are identified as contributors to inter-model differences in AMOC. These differences and biases from observations are attributed primarily to use of a wide variety of sea-ice models and diverse snow and sea-ice albedo treatmnets as well as to use of different subgrid scale parameterizations and parameter values in the ocean models. Based on the metrics considered, the majority of the models appear suitable for use in studies involving the North Atlantic, but a few models need further improvements.},

	Abstract = {The Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) plays a key role in the global climate system through its redistribution of heat. Changes in the AMOC have been associated with large fluctuations in the earth's climate in the past and projections of AMOC decline in the future due to climate change motivate the continuous monitoring of the circulation. Since 2004, the RAPID monitoring array has been providing continuous estimates of the AMOC and associated heat transport at 26$\,^{\circ}$N in the North Atlantic. We describe how these measurements are made including the sampling strategy, the accuracies of parameters measured and the calculation of the AMOC. The strength of the AMOC and meridional heat transport are estimated as 17.2Sv and 1.25PW respectively from April 2004 to October 2012. The accuracy of ten day (annual) transports is 1.5Sv (0.9Sv). Improvements to the estimation of the transport above the shallowest instruments and deepest transports (including Antarctic Bottom Water), and the use of the new equation of state for seawater have reduced the estimated strength of the AMOC by 0.6Sv relative to previous publications. As new basinwide AMOC monitoring projects begin in the South Atlantic and sub-polar North Atlantic, we present this thorough review of the methods and measurements of the original AMOC monitoring array.},

The midpoint of enhanced kinetic energy averaged over 3-year periods from 1993 to 2016 is determined across the Southern Ocean and examined to detect shifts in frontal positions, based on previous observations that kinetic energy is high around fronts in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current system due to jet instabilities. It is demonstrated that although the CKE does not represent the full eddy kinetic energy (computed from crossovers), the shape of the enhanced regions along ground tracks is the same, and CKE has a much finer spatial sampling of 6.9 km. Results indicate no significant shift in the front positions across the Southern Ocean, on average, although there are some localized, large movements. This is consistent with other studies utilizing sea surface temperature gradients, the latitude of mean transport, and the probability of jet occurrence, but is inconsistent with studies utilizing the movement of contours of dynamic topography.},

	Abstract = {A decade-mean global ocean circulation is estimated using inverse techniques, incorporating air$\backslash${\&}{\#}8211;sea fluxes of heat and freshwater, recent hydrographic sections, and direct current measurements. This information is used to determine mass, heat, freshwater, and other chemical transports, and to constrain boundary currents and dense overflows. The 18 boxes defined by these sections are divided into 45 isopycnal (neutral density) layers. Diapycnal transfers within the boxes are allowed, representing advective fluxes and mixing processes. Air$\backslash${\&}{\#}8211;sea fluxes at the surface produce transfers between outcropping layers. The model obtains a global overturning circulation consistent with the various observations, revealing two global-scale meridional circulation cells: an upper cell, with sinking in the Arctic and subarctic regions and upwelling in the Southern Ocean, and a lower cell, with sinking around the Antarctic continent and abyssal upwelling mainly below the crests of the major bathymetric ridges.},

	Abstract = {Nine hydrographic sections are combined in an inverse box model of the Southern Ocean south of similar to 12 degreesS. The inclusion of independent diapycnal flux unknowns for each property and air-sea (heat, freshwater, and momentum) fluxes make it possible to estimate the three-dimensional deep water circulation. The authors find a vigorous 50 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1) deep overturning circulation that is dominated by an equatorward flow of Lower Circumpolar Deep Water and Antarctic Bottom Water and poleward flow of upper deep water including Indian and Pacific Deep Water below 1500 dbar. In the subtropical Indian and Pacific Oceans the deep overturning cell is essentially isolated from the thermocline and intermediate waters of the subtropical gyre. The southward flowing upper deep water shoals south of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, where air-sea fluxes convert outcropping upper deep water to Antarctic surface water and drive a net air-sea transformation of 34 x 10(6) m(3) s(-1) to lighter intermediate water. It is the outcropping of upper deep water and transformation by air-sea fluxes that connects the deep and intermediate circulation cells. The significant poleward transport of relatively light (i.e., above all topography at the latitude of Drake Passage) upper deep water, as required here to balance lateral and diapycnal divergence and air-sea exchange, provides observational evidence that advection by standing and transient eddies carries significant meridional transport in the Southern Ocean.},

	Abstract = {An accurate knowledge of the ocean mean dynamic topography (MDT) is mandatory for the optimal use of altimetric data, including their assimilation into operational ocean forecasting systems. A new global 1/4$\,^{\circ}$ resolution MDT was computed for the 1993--1999 time period with improved data and methodology compared to the previous RIO05 MDT field. First, a large-scale MDT is obtained from the CLS01 altimetric Mean Sea Surface and a recent geoid model computed from 4.5 years of GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment) data. Altimetric sea level anomalies and in situ measurements are then combined to compute synthetic estimates of the MDT and the corresponding mean currents. While the RIO05 MDT was based on 10 years of in situ dynamic heights and drifting buoy velocities, the new field benefits from an enlarged data set of in situ measurements ranging from 1993 to 2008 and includes all hydrological profiles from the Argo array. Moreover, the processing of the in situ data has been updated. A new Ekman model was developed to extract the geostrophic velocity component from the drifting buoy measurements. The handling of hydrologic measurements has also been revisited. Compared to the previous RIO05 solution, the new global MDT resolves much stronger gradients in western boundary currents, with mean velocities being doubled in some places. Moreover, in comparison to several other recent MDT estimates, we find that the new CNES-CLS09 MDT is in better agreement with independent in situ observations.},

@article{Meehl2001,
	Abstract = {Historically, El Nino-like events simulated in global coupled climate models have had reduced amplitude compared to observations. Here, El Nino-like phenomena are compared in ten sensitivity experiments using two recent global coupled models. These models have various combinations of horizontal and vertical ocean resolution, ocean physics, and atmospheric model resolution. It is demonstrated that the lower the value of the ocean background vertical diffusivity, the greater the amplitude of El Nino variability which is related primarily to a sharper equatorial thermocline. Among models with low background vertical diffusivity, stronger equatorial zonal wind stress is associated with relatively higher amplitude El Nino variability along with more realistic east--west sea surface temperature (SST) gradient along the equator. The SST seasonal cycle in the eastern tropical Pacific has too much of a semiannual component with a double intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) in all experiments, and thus does not affect, nor is it affected by, the amplitude of El Nino variability. Systematic errors affecting the spatial variability of El Nino in the experiments are characterized by the eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue regime extending too far westward into the warm pool. The time scales of interannual variability (as represented by time series of Nino3 SSTs) show significant power in the 3--4 year ENSO band and 2--2.5 year tropospheric biennial oscillation (TBO) band in the model experiments. The TBO periods in the models agree well with the observations, while the ENSO periods are near the short end of the range of 3--6 years observed during the period 1950--94. The close association between interannual variability of equatorial eastern Pacific SSTs and large-scale SST patterns is represented by significant correlations between Nino3 time series and the PC time series of the first EOFs of near-global SSTs in the models and observations.},

	Abstract = {The Antarctic Circumpolar Current is an important component of the global climate system connecting the major ocean basins as it flows eastward around Antarctica, yet due to the paucity of data, it remains unclear howmuch water is transported by the current. Between 2007 and 2011 flow through Drake Passage was continuously monitored with a line of moored instrumentation with unprecedented horizontal and temporal resolution. Annual mean near-bottom currents are remarkably stable from year to year. The mean depth-independent or barotropic transport, determined from the near-bottom current meter records, was 45.6 sverdrup (Sv) with an uncertainty of 8.9 Sv. Summing the mean barotropic transport with the mean baroclinic transport relative to zero at the seafloor of 127.7 Sv gives a total transport through Drake Passage of 173.3 Sv. This new measurement is 30{\%} larger than the canonical value often used as the benchmark for global circulation and climate models.},

@article{Hewitt2016,
	Abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}There is mounting evidence that resolving mesoscale eddies and boundary currents in the surface ocean field can play an important role in air-sea interaction associated with vertical and lateral transports of heat and salt. Here we describe the development of the Met Office Global Coupled Model version 2 (GC2) with increased resolution relative to the standard model: the ocean resolution is increased from 1/4$\,^{\circ}$ to 1/12$\,^{\circ}$ (28 km to 9 km at the Equator), the atmosphere resolution increased from 60 km (N216) to 25 km (N512) and the coupling frequency increased from 3-hourly to hourly. The technical developments that were required to build a version of the model at higher resolution are described as well as results from a 20 year simulation. The results demonstrate the key role played by the enhanced resolution of the ocean model: reduced Sea Surface Temperature biases, improved ocean heat transports, deeper and stronger overturning circulation and a stronger Antarctic Circumpolar Current. Our results suggest that the improvements seen here require high resolution in both atmosphere and ocean components as well as high frequency coupling. These results add to the body of evidence suggesting that ocean resolution is an important consideration when developing coupled models for weather and climate applications.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

@article{Thompson2016,
	Abstract = { The ocean's overturning circulation is inherently three-dimensional, yet modern quantitative estimates of the overturning typically represent the subsurface circulation as a two-dimensional, two-cell streamfunction that varies with latitude and depth only. This approach suppresses information about zonal mass and tracer transport. In this article, the authors extend earlier, zonally averaged overturning theory to explore the dynamics of a ``figure-eight'' circulation that cycles through multiple basins. A three-dimensional residual-mean model of the overturning circulation is derived and then simplified to a multibasin isopycnal box model to explore how stratification and diabatic water mass transformations in each basin depend on the basin widths and on deep and bottom-water formation in both hemispheres. The idealization to multiple, two-dimensional basins permits zonal mass transport along isopycnals in a Southern Ocean--like channel, while retaining the dynamical framework of residual-mean theory. The model qualitatively reproduces the deeper isopycnal surfaces in the Pacific Basin relative to the Atlantic. This supports a transfer of Antarctic Bottom Water from the Atlantic sector to the Pacific sector via the Southern Ocean, which subsequently upwells in the northern Pacific Basin. A solution for the full isopycnal structure in the Southern Ocean reproduces observed stratification differences between Atlantic and Pacific Basins and provides a scaling for the diffusive boundary layer in which the zonal mass transport occurs. These results are consistent with observational indications that North Atlantic Deep Water is preferentially transformed into Antarctic Bottom Water, which undermines the importance of an adiabatic, upper overturning cell in the modern ocean. },
