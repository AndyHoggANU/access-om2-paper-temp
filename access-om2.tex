\begin{abstract}
We introduce a new version of the ocean-sea ice implementation of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator, ACCESS-OM2.
The model has been developed with the aim of being aligned as closely as possible with the fully coupled (atmosphere-land-ocean-sea ice) ACCESS-CM2.
In addition, the model is available at three different resolutions: a coarse resolution (nominally 1$^\circ$), an eddy-permitting resolution (nominally 0.25$^\circ$) and an eddy-rich resolution (0.1$^\circ$ with 75 vertical levels), where the eddy-rich model is designed to bridge with the Bluelink operational ocean prediction and reanalysis.
The different resolutions have been developed simultaneously, both to allow testing at low resolutions and to permit comparison across resolutions.
Here, the model is introduced and the individual components are documented. 
The model performance is evaluated across the three different resolutions, highlighting the relative advantages and disadvantages of running ocean-sea ice models at higher resolution.

\introduction  %% \introduction[modified heading if necessary]

Ocean-sea ice models have extensive applications.
They form the oceanic component of coupled climate and Earth system models that are used for projecting future climate, and can incorporate biogeochemical and ecosystem dynamics which extend the realm of application.
They are also needed for forecasting on shorter timescales -- both forecasting in the ocean and for seasonal prediction of the ocean/sea ice/atmosphere state.
As a research tool, ocean-sea ice models can be used to quantitatively test, or experiment with, the dynamics of the climate system; such process studies have been invaluable in forming a broad understanding of the drivers of climate change and variability.

Modelling studies face the universal challenge of the compromise between resolving critical processes and computational expense.
For example, the standard resolution for the ocean component of coupled climate models is 1$^\circ$, with indications that some models being prepared for the next Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) will use 0.25$^\circ$ horizontal resolution.
However, 1$^\circ$ models do not resolve the ocean mesoscale, meaning that they miss key processes that can influence the climate. 
Higher resolution models have an improved climate state with better estimates of vertical heat transport \citep{Griffies2015}, enhancement of boundary currents \citep{Hewitt2016}, better resolution of ocean straits and improved Southern Ocean state \citep{Bishop2016}.
On the other hand, these high resolution simulations consume huge computational resources, which limits the length of runs and the ability to run multiple tests to optimise parameters.
Thus, while higher resolution models are becoming computationally feasible, the additional resolution does not necessarily result in improved simulations.

One of the complexities in characterising model performance as a function of resolution is the influence of model biases governing the model state.
It is well known that different models subjected to the same forcing produce widely varying mean states \citep[e.g.][]{Danabasoglu:2014}.
It follows that the effects of model resolution require a clean hierarchy; a model suite in which variations in resolution are available with homogeneous code, forcing and, as far as possible, parameter choices.
This is a technique successfully employed by the DRAKKAR consortium \citep{Barnier2014} as well as climate model developers \citep[e.g.][]{Hewitt2016}.

In this manuscript we outline the development of the latest version of the ocean-sea ice component of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulation, known as ACCESS-OM2.
This model is being developed to serve the twin aims of underpinning climate model development and ocean state forecasting; it therefore includes parallel development of low, medium and high resolution options.
The model is also designed to be used for process model studies. 
In this manuscript we aim to document the model formulation (\S 2) and the computational performance of the model at each resolution (\S3).
We also undertake a preliminary evaluation of the global model state, included selected regional analyses and the model representation of sea ice (\S4).

\section{Model Formulation}
\CONTRIBUTORS{This section is currently being drafted as part of the ACCESS-OM2 technical report by Andrew Kiss. Once complete, a cut-down version of the technical report will be included here.}

Model configurations at three horizontal resolutions have been developed, named ACCESS-OM2 (nominally 1$^\circ$ horizontal resolution), ACCESS-OM2-025 (nominally 0.25$^\circ$) and ACCESS-OM2-01 (nominally 0.1$^\circ$).
The suite of three resolutions is also collectively referred to as ACCESS-OM2.
Configurations (e.g.\ run parameters and forcing) are as consistent as possible across the three resolutions to facilitate studies of resolution dependence and sub-gridscale parameterisations. 
The coarser models served as testbeds for developing correct configurations at higher resolutions, and are suitable for long experiments covering climatological timescales of hundreds of years, but are not eddy-resolving.
%They are intended for incorporation into future versions of the ACCESS-CM global coupled climate model.
In contrast, the ACCESS-OM2-01 configuration resolves the first baroclinic deformation radius away from shelves and equatorward of about 50$^\circ$ \citep{Hallberg2013a}, and therefore resolves the mesoscale in most of the world ocean. 
%It is suitable for runs of several decades and is intended to form the basis of the next generation of the Bluelink operational ocean forecasting system.

ACCESS-OM2 consists of two-way coupled ocean and sea ice models driven by a prescribed atmosphere (see Figure~\ref{F:coupling}).
The ocean model component is the Modular Ocean Model (MOM) version 5.1 from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (\url{https://mom-ocean.github.io}), and the sea ice component (\url{https://github.com/OceansAus/cice5/}) is a fork from the Los Alamos sea ice model (CICE) version 5.1.2 from Los Alamos National Laboratories (\url{https://github.com/CICE-Consortium/CICE-svn-trunk/tree/cice-5.1.2}).
These components are forced by prescribed atmospheric conditions taken from the 55-year Japanese Reanalysis for driving oceans \citep[JRA55-do,][]{TsujinoETAL2018a} via YATM (\url{https://github.com/OceansAus/libaccessom2/}).
The model components are coupled via Ocean Atmosphere Sea Ice Soil (OASIS3-MCT) version 2.0 from CERFACS and CNRS, France (\url{https://portal.enes.org/oasis}).
%The exact source code and inputs used for the experiments discussed here are listed in Table~\ref{T:configs}.
The ACCESS-OM2 model source code is hosted at \url{https://github.com/OceansAus/access-om2}.

\section{Computational Performance}
\CONTRIBUTORS{Andy Hogg \& Marshall Ward.}

The computational performance of a coupled model depends upon the individual performance of each of the component models, as well as the load balancing between each component.
The computational load for ACCESS-OM2 is dominated by MOM5, \TODO{check} with a modest contribution from CICE5 and negligible load from the coupling and file-based atmospheric input.
Therefore, we first investigate in detail MOM5 scalability across a wide variety of core counts.
Despite playing a smaller computational role, the performance of CICE5 plays limits the scalability of the coupled model, and performance is also variable.
Finally, the performance of the fully coupled model is inferred from the independent performance of CICE5 and MOM5, leading to recommended standard configurations.
All simulations were performed on Raijin, the peak machine at Australia's National Computation Infrastructure.
\TODO{provide a few details on raijin hardware - eg is it communication, memory or io bound for this application?}

\subsection{MOM5 Scalability}
\TODO{Marshall - please check these details! }

We conduct a series of tests into the scalability of MOM5 at each of the three model resolutions tested here.
In each test we record the main loop runtime per baroclinic timestep for 3 short simulations over a prescribed core count, and repeat this test for different numbers of core counts.
The length of each simulation in model time is set to ensure a runtime of approximately 3 minutes, and varies from 2 months at the lowest resolution to 1 day at the highest resolution.
We report the runtime per model timestep (Fig. \ref{fig:scaling_ocn}a) and the total CPU time (Fig. \ref{fig:scaling_ocn}b) for each configuration.
Each point denotes the average runtime over all MPI ranks for each run.
Note that the numbers provided here do not include startup time, which can add considerable cost especially at high core counts.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{scaling_ocn.png}
\caption{Scaling performance for MOM5 global model simulations showing (a) walltime, and (b) CPU time per ocean baroclinic timestep for a short simulation at each model resolution. \label{fig:scaling_ocn}}
\end{figure}

These tests demonstrate the highly efficient scalability of MOM5. 
For the standard (1$^\circ$ resolution) ACCESS-OM2 configuration, the model scales well to core counts of 400, and only begins to degrade at 800 cores.
At 400 cores, one model year takes just 10 minutes (equivalent to a theoretical maximum of 144 model years per day) which far exceeds the required performance for such a model.
At higher resolution, MOM5 is slower, but still scales outstandingly well -- up to 4000 cores for ACCESS-OM2-025 and 16,000 cores for ACCESS-OM2-01.
In the latter case, MOM5 alone could simulate a theoretical maximum of almost 5 years per day at 0.1$^\circ$ resolution, although startup and model I/O would reduce the speed in any practical case.

These scaling tests highlight the efficiency of MOM5 at high core counts, giving us flexibility to choose different MOM5 core counts for different configurations.
However, the behaviour of the coupled model is also dependent on CICE5 performance, as outlined below.

\subsection{CICE Scalability}
\CONTRIBUTORS{Andy Hogg \& Marshall Ward.}
\TODO{This section will show graphs of CICE5  scalability (?at each of the 3 resolutions?). It will show that CICE can scale quite well,  but that load balancing can be an issue. It might also be nice to show seasonal variability in CICE, the dependence of the amount of work on latitude (model state?) and how maxblocks results in an improvement in performance for large core counts.}

\subsection{Coupled Model Performance}
\CONTRIBUTORS{Andy Hogg \& Marshall Ward.}
\TODO{This section will outline the complexities of putting together the above scaling numbers into a fully coupled model. The point is that the coupling overhead is small, but that load balancing remains a big issue, especially if timesteps vary, the model state changes, etc...}

The standard configurations, core counts and computational costs of differing model resolutions is shown in table \ref{tab:perf} \ldots

ACCESS-OM2 & 1$^\circ$ & $360 \times 300$ & 50 & 2.3~m & 5400 & 252 & 60 & 160\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
\section{Model evaluation}
We now proceed to outline results from initial simulations with ACCESS-OM2 using simulations with each of the three standard horizontal resolutions outlined in Table \ref{tab:perf}.
Each of the three simulations is forced by the interannual JRA55-do forcing dataset  \citep{TsujinoETAL2018a}, which  currently covers 60 years from 1958 until the end of 2017.
The  lower resolution simulations (both ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025) continuously run through five iterations of this dataset, giving a 300-year simulation, following the CORE-II protocol \citep[e.g.][]{Danabasoglu:2014}.
These simulations are shown by the blue and orange lines (respectively) in figure \ref{fig:timeseries}, where dates have been aligned so that the last cycle of forcing matches the calendar dates of the forcing dataset (giving a nominal start year of 1718).
The main period of model evaluation will be the final interannual forcing cycle, years 1958--2017 inclusive.
When time-averaged fields are shown, averages are taken over the last 25 years of simulation, years 1993-2017 inclusive, unless stated otherwise.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=12cm]{GlobalTimeseries.pdf}
\caption{Timeseries of the global average of (a) temperature; (b) surface salinity; (c) sea level and (d) kinetic energy for each of the simulations. 
Output is shown for the full interannually forced model simulations, including 5 IAF cycles for ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2025.
Time has been offset to ensure that the final cycle has a date that is consistent with the forcing date, allowing the short, 33 year, ACCESS-OM2-01 simulation to be plotted on the same time axis.\label{fig:timeseries}}
\end{figure}

The highest resolution simulation, using ACCESS-OM2-01, is $O(1000)$ times more computationally intensive than ACCESS-OM2, and $O(30)$ times more computationally intensive than ACCESS-OM2-025.
A full simulation with five internannual forcing cycles of ACCESS-OM2-01 is not possible with current computing resources, and hence we use an alternative spinup strategy. 
In this case we select a Repeat Year Forcing (RYF) spinup strategy (Stewart et al., Paper in Preparation), in which the time period May 1984 to April 1985 is repeated continuously.
This spinup has been run for 40 years (green dashed line in figure \ref{fig:timeseries}), after which time we conduct an interannually forced simulation from 1985 through to 2017. 
It is this interannual simulation period which is used for the model evaluation in this manuscript, as indicated by the solid green line in figure \ref{fig:timeseries}.
It is important to note that this simulation is less well equilibrated than the lower resolution simulations, and so care must be taken in interpreting the influence of model drift on the different cases.

The timeseries of globally averaged quantities shown in figure \ref{fig:timeseries} indicate that there is a drift due to  heat uptake in ACCESS-OM2-025, while ACCESS-OM2-01 drifts cold relative to the initial state (Fig. \ref{fig:timeseries}a), primarily during the repeat year spinup phase.
The high resolution model also drifts towards surface freshening, which is partly offset by the surface salinity restoring that is incorporated into the model (Fig. \ref{fig:timeseries}b).
The global sea surface height variation is dominated by the interannual forcing cycle, and is independent of resolution (Fig. \ref{fig:timeseries}c). 
As expected, the kinetic energy of the simulations is a strong function of resolution, with higher resolution models containing more turbulent processes (Fig. \ref{fig:timeseries}d).
Each of these aspects of the simulations is investigated in greater depth by the following analysis, where we first focus on global circulation metrics, then look to better characterise important regional ocean circulation differences and finally investigate the representation of sea ice.

\subsection{Global circulation}

\subsubsection{Horizontal circulation}
One of the most commonly used integrated metrics for ocean model circulation is the transport of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) through Drake Passage.
Figure \ref{fig:drake} shows the Drake Passage transport for the final forcing cycle for each of the three simulations being compared.
There is a clear distinction between the ACC transport in the lower resolution simulations and in ACCESS-OM2-01.
In the former case, the larger ACC transport is close to the observational estimate of 173 Sv \citep[black dashed line; ][]{Donohue2016}, with significant decadal variability. 
Transport in ACCESS-OM2-01 has significantly lower transport, and is more stable. 
The underestimated ACC transport in these models is characteristic of this class of ocean-sea ice models \citep[e.g.][]{Farneti2015}, but it is noticeable that the higher resolution case does not lead to an improved transport.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=8.3cm]{DP_transport.pdf}
\caption{Transport through Drake Passage as a function of time for each of the 3 model simulations. The black dashed line shows the observational estimates of Donohue et al. (2016). \label{fig:drake}}
\end{figure}

To evaluate the capacity of the different model configurations to represent the mean state of the broad-scale horizontal ocean circulation, the simulated mean dynamic topography (MDT) averaged over the final 25 years of each experiment (corresponding to the years 1993--2017) is compared with the CNES-CLS13 observational product distributed by AVISO, which combines data from satellites, surface drifters and in-situ measurements to reconstruct a time mean, global MDT field for the period between 1993 and 2012. 
The reconstruction procedure is described in \citet{Rio2011}. 
The comparisons between the simulated and observed MDTs are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:mdt}, indicating broad-scale agreement in this metric.
There is a noticeable improvement in western boundary current structure in the higher resolution models, and a deeper MDT minimum in the ACCESS-OM2-025 case, consistent with the enhanced Drake Passage transport shown in Fig. \ref{fig:drake} (again, we hypothesise that lower MDT is caused by spurious polynya activity creating more dense water in this region).

We also evaluate the capacity of the different model configurations to represent the spatial patterns of sea-level variability, as this provides a reliable proxy surface mesoscale activity. 
To do this, we compute the standard deviation of the sea-level anomaly (SLA) for each configuration, once again computed using the final 25 years of model output, at each model grid point, to produce global maps of SLA deviation. 
The simulated SLA standard deviation is then compared with the objectively interpolated, multi-mission satellite derived, SLA product (AVISO Ssalto/Duacs) distributed by Copernicus Marine and Environment Monitoring Systems. 
Statistics are calculated for the years 1993--2017 and long-term linear trends are removed. 
We use the gridded observational product for convenience in comparing global maps of SLA variability. 
However, we note that the optimal interpolation procedure used to produce the gridded product from satellite ground tracks tends to smooth the underlying fields and hence may underestimate the SLA variance by as much as 50\% in certain regions \citep{Chambers2018}. 
As such, the true SLA variability may be higher than is indicated here. 

The maps of SLA standard deviation are plotted in Fig. \ref{fig:SL-RMS}.   
Elevated SLA variability typically occurs in regions rich in energetic mesoscale eddies. 
For example, the altimetric product (Fig. \ref{fig:SL-RMS}(d)) shows elevated SLA variability in western boundary currents and their jet extensions, as well as in the Southern Ocean, which are regions where mesoscale dynamics are most active. 
Both the ACCESS-OM2-01 and ACCESS-OM-025 simulations appear to capture this spatial pattern of SLA well, with both boundary currents and the Southern Ocean playing host to regions of enhanced SLA standard deviation. 
However, the ACCESS-OM-025 configuration is unable to capture the magnitude of the observed variability, with values a factor of two or more below those of the observational product. 
In contrast, the ACCESS-OM-01 configuration accurately captures both the spatial patterns of SLA variability and their magnitudes, with the highest values being found south of the African continent in the Agulhas retroflection region, and the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio extension. 
The coarse-resolution ACCESS-OM2 configuration is unable to capture the observed SLA variability.

\subsubsection{Overturning circulation}
Figure \ref{fig:overturning} shows the overturning circulation, computed on $\sigma_2$ surfaces, averaged over the last 25 years of simulation (1993-2017) for each of the three cases.
In this figure, the positive cell which has a maximum near potential density 1036.5 kg m$^{-3}$ is the interhemispheric upper overturning cell which is dominated by the Atlantic component.
This Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) involves sinking of dense water in the North Atlantic, which re-emerges at the surface in the Southern Ocean \citep{MarshallSpeer2012a}. 
There are clear differences between the three resolutions in their ability to represent the AMOC cell, which has an estimated transport from 2004 to 2012 of 17.2\,Sv at $26^\circ$N \citep{McCarthy:2015}.
In ACCESS-OM2, the AMOC at 26$^\circ$N is weak, with a maximum value of around 10 Sv, but it retains a strong interhemispheric character. 
In ACCESS-OM2-025 the AMOC is much weaker in the northern hemisphere, while in ACCESS-OM2-01 the AMOC remains relatively strong.
A timeseries of the AMOC, measured at 26$^\circ$N and constrained to the Atlantic basin only, clearly shows these differences (Figure \ref{fig:overturning_timeseries}a), but also shows a decline over the duration of the ACCESS-OM2-01 case.
The comparison of the AMOC in ACCESS-OM2-01 with the years from McCarthy's estimate, but we cannot distinguish from this simulation whether this agreement is a fortuitous intersection as the model equilibrates, or whether this result is repeatable.
Longer simulations are required before we can establish the equilibrium AMOC for this model.

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{mean_overturning.png}
\caption{Time-mean zonally-integrated overturning circulation computed on $\sigma_2$ density surfaces for (a) ACCESS-OM2; (b) ACCESS-OM2-025 and (c) ACCESS-OM2-01 simulations. Overturning is computed on density surfaces, integrated zonally around the globe and averaged over the last 25 years of simulation (1993--2017). \label{fig:overturning}}
\end{figure}

The other circulation cell of interest in Figure \ref{fig:overturning} is the abyssal overturning cell (the negative cell centred at 1037 kg/m$^{-3}$), which occupies a small part of density space but comprises a significant fraction of global water volume.
Here, ACCESS-OM2-01 has a strong overturning cell \citep[10--15\,Sv at $40^\circ$S, see figure \ref{fig:overturning_timeseries}b; compared with poorly constrained observational estimates of 20--50,Sv;][]{Sloyan2001,Lumpkin2007,Talley2013}.
We show below that in ACCESS-OM2-01 the abyssal cell is driven by the more realistic process of water mass transformation on the Antarctic continental shelf.
On the other hand, the ACCESS-OM2-025 and ACCESS-OM2 abyssal cells are more dependent on water mass transformation due to open ocean convection, but this dense water is poorly connected with the rest of the global ocean, leading to a weaker ($\sim$8-10 Sv) overturning transport at 40$^\circ$S.
These biases in water mass transformation are common in coarse resolution ocean and climate models \citep{Heuze2015}, indicating the potential of ACCESS-OM2-01 to be used for studies into the abyssal cell sensitivity to changes in climate.

\subsubsection{Heat transport} 

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=8cm]{meridional_heat_transport_withadv_withobs.pdf}
\caption{Meridional heat transport (PW) calculated by integrating the surface heat flux in latitude (solid lines) and from the resolved temperature advection (dashed lines).
  Observed estimates from \citet{Trenberth2001} inferred from both NCEP and ECMWF reanalysis data over the period February 1985 -- April 1989 are shown for comparison.
  For the surface heat flux method (solid lines), drift in the ocean's heat content is evident in the non-zero total meridional heat transport at $90^\circ$S and $90^\circ$N (where half the non-zero total meridional heat transport at $90^\circ$N obtained from the latitude integral has been added to equalise the impact of this drift across latitude).
  Note that the direct method (dashed lines) does not include the components of the meridional heat flux associated with the submesoscale parameterization or with GM and neutral diffusion (which are active in the $1^\circ$ and $0.25^\circ$ models and account for the differences in the Southern Ocean).
  \label{fig:MHT}}
\end{figure}

All three model configurations have weaker poleward heat transport than suggested by reanalysis products (Fig. \ref{fig:MHT}).
This weak poleward heat transport is a feature of many coupled models \citet[e.g.][]{Griffies2015} and is commonly associated with a weak simulated AMOC \citep{Wang2014} and/or biases in the Southern Ocean.
ACCESS-OM2-01 simulates a stronger northward heat transport than the other two configurations, likely associated with its stronger AMOC (Fig. \ref{fig:overturning}).
\TODO{Could be more descriptive here.}
% Fig. \ref{fig:MHT} also indicates that the heat content drift in ACCESS-OM2-025 (orange line in Fig. \ref{fig:timeseries}) is associated with heat entering at a range of latitudes mainly between $40^\circ$S and $25^\circ$N (compare orange solid and dashed lines in Fig. \ref{fig:MHT}).

\subsection{Regional ocean circulation}\label{sec:regional}

The second part of this model evaluation involves examining the performance of  the model at a selected number of key regions, and at each resolution. 
In these regional analyses we will focus on the major circulation features such as the separation of western boundary currents, the average state of equatorial currents and flow through major choke points. 
The regional evaluation is not intended to be exhaustive; but instead will outline regions in which the model behaves well or poorly.
It is envisaged that more in-depth analyses will be published using this model in the near future.

\end{figure}

The Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) from the Pacific Ocean to the Indian Ocean is the only tropical inter-ocean pathway in the global ocean circulation.
The magnitude of the mean ITF transport at different locations in the Indonesian Seas is a good indicator of the robustness of the model for this region. Figure \ref{fig:ITF_transport} shows, for the three simulations, the time series of the total ITF transport and the transport through the three main outflow straits (Lombok Strait, Ombai Strait and Timor Passage).
The dashed horizontal lines represent the mean observed transport obtained from the INSTANT program \citep{Sprintall2009}. 
First of all, we can notice that the total transport varies between the three simulations, with the ACCESS-OM2-01 simulation in good agreement with the observations but a lower total transport for the ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025 simulations. 
ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025 underestimate the transport for two primary reasons.
First, the ITF transport from the Pacific to the Indian Ocean is induced by the pressure gradient between these two oceans; in ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025, this pressure gradient is weaker than observed nd 10\% smaller than in ACCESS-OM2-01; thus, is not strong enough to reproduce the observed total transport (Fig. \ref{fig:mdt}).
Second, the Lombok and Ombai Straits are very narrow (Lombok Strait has a minimum width of 20 km and Ombai Strait a minimum width of 40 km) and therefore require a relatively high horizontal resolution.
For example, the width of Lombok Strait is 1 cell ($\sim$ 100 km) in ACCESS-OM2, 2 cells in ACCESS-OM2-025 ($\sim$ 50 km) and 3 cells in ACCESS-OM2-01 ($\sim$ 30 km).
However, the wide strait in ACCESS-OM2 is partially compensated by the addition of Rayleigh drag -- an engineering solution to limit the flow in this region. 
Third, the ITF outflow is split between the three main straits flowing first through the Lombok Strait, then the Ombai Strait and finally the Timor Strait.
So if more water that comes through the Makassar Strait goes through Lombok strait (as in ACCESS-OM2-025), less water will go through the Timor Passage. 
In short, the resolution of straits is critical for this region, and for this reason the ACCESS-OM2-01 is more appropriate to study the Indonesian Seas.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Pacific Ocean}


All three versions of ACCESS-OM2 reproduce the major features of the equatorial Pacific Ocean circulation well compared to observations (Fig. \ref{fig:eqpac}). 
The strength of the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) core is within 10\% of observations and its latitudinal width at $140^\circ$W is accurate in ACCESS-OM2-025 and ACCESS-OM2-01 (being somewhat too wide in ACCESS-OM2). 
The strength of the thermocline is well reproduced in ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025, although in ACCESS-OM2-01 it is slightly too strong. 
The strong thermocline in ACCESS-OM2-01 may be a consequence of the lack of background diffusivity \citep[e.g.][]{Meehl2001}. 
% In ACCESS-OM2-025 and ACCESS-OM2-1 the thermocline strength may be limited by numerical diffusion associated with the low vertical resolution and zero background diffusivity in these two configurations.
The vertical temperature gradient above the thermocline appears to be too weak in all three configurations, a bias which may also be linked to the weak vertical shear in the upper EUC.
Further, both the northern and southern branches of the South Equatorial Current (SEC, the westward surface-intensified current between $\pm5^\circ$ latitude) are too weak in the models.
These biases in the SEC and upper EUC may be associated with problems in the turbulent mixing parameterizations in this region, but a detailed sensitivity study has not yet been undertaken.
The eastwards North Equatorial Counter Current (NECC) at $7^\circ$N is very weak in the models. 
A weak northern SEC branch and NECC are common biases in ocean models \citep[e.g][]{Large2001,Tseng2016}.
Finally, the EUC extends too deeply in both ACCESS-OM2-025 and ACCESS-OM2-01.

\caption{Comparison of temperature (color, $^\circ$C) and zonal velocity (white contours with black labels in cm\,s$^{-1}$) along the Equator (left) and at $220^\circ$E (right) in the Pacific between the ACCESS-OM2 models and observations \citep[][bottom two panels]{Johnson2002a}.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:Transect_Pacific} shows meridional transects of the climatological means of potential temperature and practical salinity across the approximate centre of the basin at 150$^{\circ}$W (near the WOCE repeat hydrography line P16) for each model configuration. For comparison, we include an observational estimate of the climatological mean along the same transect, taken from the gridded WOA13 product, for  the period 1985-2013 (shown in Fig. \ref{fig:Transect_Pacific}(d)i--ii). We note that, in general, all three model configurations produce a realistic thermal structure in this basin. In particular, the models capture the approximate depth of the thermocline and its inter-hemispheric asymmetry (with the southern hemisphere thermocline being somewhat deeper than in the northern hemisphere), the strong temperature gradients in Southern Ocean at approximately 55$^{\circ}$S, coincident with the location of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, and the weak vertical gradients to the north of the ACC in the regions associated with southern hemisphere mode-water production. We note, however, that at approximately 50$^{\circ}$S, the this region of weakly stratified water is substantially deeper in the high-resolution ACCESS-OM2-01 simulation than in either the ACCESS-OM2 or ACCESS-OM2-025 configurations, or the WOA13 observations, suggestive of overproduction of sub-Antarctic mode water.        

\begin{figure}[t]
\includegraphics[width=\hsize]{Model_vs_WOA13_Temp_Salt_P16.pdf}
\caption{Meridional transects of potential temperature (upper panels) and practical salinity (lower panels) in the central Pacific Ocean, along longitude 150$^{\circ}$W, near the WOCE repeat\TODO{check - is it actually a repeat line?} hydrographic line P16, for (a)  ACCESS-OM2; (b) ACCESS-OM2-025; (c) ACCESS-OM2-01;  and (d) gridded climatologies from WOA13 for the period 1985--2013. 
\TODO{plot a,b,c as biases?}
\label{fig:Transect_Pacific}}
\end{figure}

In contrast to the temperature structure, which was simulated reasonably well by the various models in this suite, the meridional haline structure of the central Pacific is not well simulated. In particular, none of the models are able to reproduce the observed deep salinity minimum in either hemipshere, although there is some suggestion of penetration of relatively fresh waters into the interior at approximately 55$^{\circ}$S and 45$^{\circ}$N in the ACCESS-OM2-025 and ACCESS-OM2-01 configurations. As such, it is likely that the models' representation of Pacific mode and intermediate waters will be affected by the poor representation of the deep salinity structure, which could, in turn, have implications of the local overturning circulation \citep{Thompson2016}.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{North Atlantic Ocean}

As in Fig. \ref{fig:Transect_Pacific}, Fig. \ref{fig:Transect_Atlantic} shows a meridional transects of the mean potential temperature and practical salinity across the approximate center of the basin at 25$^{\circ}$W (near the WOCE repeat hydrography line A16) for each model configuration and the gridded WOA13 product. In general, while all three model configurations produce the basic hydrographic structure of the central Atlantic, several aspects are poorly represented, particularly by the two coarser resolution simulations. In particular, while the observations show marked inter-hemispheric asymmetry in the thermocline structure (with the southern hemisphere thermocline being substantially shallower than the northern hemisphere), the ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025 configurations show approximately equal thermocline depths in both hemispheres. This problem is somewhat ameliorated in ACCESS-OM2-01, which produces a southern hemisphere thermocline with a 10$^{\circ}$C isotherm that is approximately 800m deeper at 40$^{\circ}$N than 40$^{\circ}$S, which is similar to that obtained from the WOA13 product ($\sim$900m), although we note that the thermocline is somewhat deeper in the north Atlantic in the WOA13 observations than in the ACCESS-OM2-01 fields. 

Similarly, the ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025 models do not produce the southern hemisphere deep salinity minimum observed at latitude of approximately 50$^{\circ}$S and a depth of approximately 1000m. However, the salinity minimum is reproduced quite well by the ACCESS-OM2-01 model, which is able to capture both the structure and approximate magnitude. Curiously, while the high resolution ACCESS-OM2-01 is not able to capture the northern hemisphere deep salinity maximum (present in the WOA13 observations at an approximate latitude of 40$^{\circ}$N and an approximate depth of 1100m), both the lower resolution ACCESS-OM2 and ACCESS-OM2-025 configurations capture this feature with varying degrees of fidelity (the high salinity zone is too broad in the ACCESS-OM2 simulation and too shallow by 100-200m in both configurations).

\subsubsection{Indian Ocean}

As in previous sections, we plot time-mean transects of potential temperature and practical salinity across the central Indian ocean (longitude 95$^{\circ}$E, near the I08--09 WOCE repeat hydrography line) from the three different model configurations, as well as from the WOA13 climatology, for the period 1985--2013. In the Indian Ocean, all 3 model configurations perform well, producing the basic structure of both temperature and salinity extremely well, including the high meridional temperature gradients near 50$^{\circ}$S associated with the ACC, the low vertical temperature gradients near 40$^\circ$S associated with the formation of mode and intermediate waters, the deep salinity minima in the southern hemisphere at around 1500m depth, and the band of very fresh surface waters north of the equator.
